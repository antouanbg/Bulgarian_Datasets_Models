UDPipe is a trainable pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing of CoNLL-U files. 
UDPipe is language-agnostic and can be trained given annotated data in CoNLL-U format. 
Trained models are provided for nearly all UD treebanks. 
UDPipe is available as a binary for Linux/Windows/OS X, as a library for C++, Python, Perl, Java, C#, and as a web service. 
Third-party R CRAN package also exists.

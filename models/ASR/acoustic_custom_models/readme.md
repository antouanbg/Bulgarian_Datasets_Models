We are uploading here the available acoustic custom made models invented by different projects and organizations:
________
1. Thanks to our friends from Montreal Forced Aligner (https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/):
https://github.com/antouanbg/Bulgarian_Datasets_Models/blob/master/models/ASR/acoustic_custom_models/bulgarian.zip

2. If you would like to use it, please download it below. Please note the dictionary that they were trained with to see more information about the phone set. When using these with a pronunciation dictionary, the phone sets must be compatible. If the orthography of the language is transparent, it is likely that a G2P model can be used to generate the necessary pronunciation dictionary!

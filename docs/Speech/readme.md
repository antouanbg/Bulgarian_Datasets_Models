[Praat](http://www.praat.org/), a computer program with which you can analyse, synthesize, and manipulate speech, 
and create high-quality pictures for your articles and thesis. Labelling and segmentation is also possible. While the Praat website contains the latest executable for all platforms that we support (or used to support), the releases on GitHub contain many older [executables]((https://github.com/praat/praat/releases)) as well too.
